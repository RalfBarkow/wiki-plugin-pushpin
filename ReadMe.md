# Federated Wiki (experimental) - Push Pin Plugin

*This federated wiki plugin is part of an experimental code refactoring, which is very much a work in progress. See [WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki) (ruby), or [WardCunningham/wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/wiki) (node), for the current stable versions.*

We plot locations on a map by creating dots that are attracted to their proper place but resist overlaping other dots attracted to similar locations.
